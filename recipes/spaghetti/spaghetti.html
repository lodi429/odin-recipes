		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This is a very basic spaghetti recipe I pulled off of Google. The image isn't even of the spaghetti, but I have made spaghetti just like this before. Struggle meal. Spaghetti is actually very cost effective without ground beef, fun fact.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Box of Spaghetti</li>
			<li>1 Jar of Marinara Sauce</li>
			<li>1 Pound of Ground Beef</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions</li>
			<li>Brown the ground beef, season it to taste while you cook it.</li>
			<li>Once beef is finished cooking, add the pasta sauce to the pan.</li>
			<li>Cook until the pasta sauce is cooked through, also season that to taste.</li>
			<li>Once done with meat sauce, either add all spaghetti to the sauce or just eat it by adding the sauce over the spaghetti. I like to mix the spaghetti and meat sauce together, just like my mom did.</li>
